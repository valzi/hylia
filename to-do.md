- add comments and/or webmentions
- ~~the word "twitter" hovering to the right of the banner image~~
- Center the logo maybe?
- "~~Blog for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil" seems to belong below the blog title or banner image rather than in the header that says "POSTS"~~
- ~~I'd give a bit of vertical margin between "Deliberations & Determinations" and the banner image (try 1em maybe?)~~
- ~~I'd see if one could reasonably trim the brown margin space around POSTS vertically~~
- ~~Personally I would go back to the blog title in Quentin EF and have it be at the very top of the page at all times, with post titles done differently?~~
- I'd put in 0.5em to 1em of vertical margin between "TAGS:" and the tag buttons. I'd remove the colon from the end of TAGS:
