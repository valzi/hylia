Dungeon of Signs made a very <a href="http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2016/10/monster-design-and-necessity.html">useful post</a> that provides a nice middle-ground between using a pre-made bestiary for your encounter table and just making something up entirely from scratch. He made a table for generating just the mechanical elements for each monster, leaving the theme and specifics of each monster for the GM to decide afterward.

I was starting to use the table and decided I'd rather automatically roll it with a generator since I was working at a computer instead of at a table with dice and paper. Here it is:

<div style="overflow: auto; padding-top: 100%; position: relative;">
<iframe src="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/embed/chart/4847" style="border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;"></iframe></div>
