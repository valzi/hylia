I've acquired a lot of the best elements of my game from the OD&D school of design.

OD&D (Original Dungeons and Dragons) isn't just a worse version of B/X (Basic/Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.) It's a different thing. The two systems have a lot in common, but they're different.

### Reading List

In order:\
0.[Mentzer's Basic Dungeons and Dragons Player's Guide](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/116578/DD-Basic-Set--Players-Manual-BECMI-ed-Basic) and[DM's Rulebook](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/116619/DD-Basic-Set--DMs-Rulebook-BECMI-ed-Basic) (so you can learn what an RPG even is. Probably every last one of you reading this can skip this one.)\
1.[Philotomy's Musings](http://save.vs.totalpartykill.ca/grab-bag/philotomy/)(so you can see the kinds of design choices OD&D is likely to push you toward)\
2.[Delving Deeper](http://forum.immersiveink.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=113)(so you can read OD&D without reading those messy little brown books, Greyhawk, Chainmail, etc and mash them together as best as you can)\
3.[White Box: FMAG](http://whiteboxgame.blogspot.com/)(for a somewhat interpreted/altered OD&D)\
4. Dungeon of Signs blog (For some of the coolest stuff I've ever seen anyone do with OD&D, especially the[player's guide](http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2016/08/hms-appolyon-players-guide-part-1.html)and this[post which contains some updated rules](http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2017/07/hms-apollyon-viking-character.html). You can browse through the[player's guide tag](http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/search/label/Player%27s%20Guide)to find more classes and such.)\
5.[Into the Odd](http://www.bastionland.com/)(for a modern game that feels like OD&D might have been if it had been written a few years ago. The blog posts are some of the best blog posts anywhere too.)\
6. Necropraxis (a blog with a lot of good[OD&D-related](https://www.necropraxis.com/tag/odd/)theory and house rules.)\

***But I don't know anything, so please comment to tell everyone what else is great.***
