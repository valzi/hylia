I've acquired a lot of the best elements of my game from the OD&D school of design.

OD&D (Original Dungeons and Dragons) isn't a worse version of B/X (Basic/Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.) It's a different thing. The two systems have a lot in common, but they're different. Neither is a worse version of whatever OSR ruleset you might use. They're different. They're very tight designs.

## OD&D Reading List

Read in order.

1. [Philotomy's Musings](http://save.vs.totalpartykill.ca/grab-bag/philotomy/) to help you see why you'd want to read OD&D and why you'd want to run it or borrow from it.
2. [Dungeons and Dragons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/28306/ODD-Dungeons--Dragons-Original-Edition-0e) is also known as OE, 0E, OD&D (Original Dungeons and Dragons), and White Box.
3. [Delving Deeper](http://forum.immersiveink.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=113) is a clearer restatement of OD&D with only very minimal changes.
3. [White Box: FMAG](http://whiteboxgame.blogspot.com/) is a somewhat altered OD&D.
4. [Dungeon of Signs blog filtered by the player's guide tag](http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/search/label/Player%27s%20Guide) has some of the coolest stuff I've seen done with OD&D.
5. [Necropraxis](https://www.necropraxis.com/tag/odd/) is a blog with a lot of good OD&D-related theory and house rules.

## Honorable mentions 
- [Into the Odd/Electric Bastionland](http://www.bastionland.com/) is a modern game that feels like OD&D might have been if it had been written a few years ago. The blog posts are essential supplements to Into the Odd, but Electric Bastionland might be a bit more complete when it releases.
- [ Moldvay's Basic Dungeons and Dragons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) will clarify what an oldschool RPG even is. Modern thinking sometimes gets a bit muddied.
