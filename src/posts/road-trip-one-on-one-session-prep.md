I want to GM a one-on-one game while I drive for many hours on a few different days. I'm writing out my plans here in case anyone else wants to try it. You probably shouldn't. The GM should probably be the passenger while someone else drives. In my case, this is not true.

DO NOT EVER do anything that distracts you from driving. If you can't keep your mind on the road, don't do this. Don't listen to audiobooks. Don't listen to podcasts. Etc.

Please make suggestions! Tell me what you would try. Tell me how I will horribly fail.

## Limitations

* The GM cannot reference *anything.*
* Only the player may roll dice.
* System: Knave (Simple, OSR-compatible rules with surprising depth. Designed to accommodate player-rolls.)

## Considerations

A deck of index cards labeled 1-20 could replace dice.

Instead, we'll place dice in a baby food container and shake them inside of it.

## Scenario options

* Generate a Yoon-Suin situation, write notes, leave notes at home.
* Memorize a one-page dungeon and leave it at home
* Run one of my own dungeons to the best of my memory.
* Guard a caravan (See*Incorporate the Drive* below.)

(I chose the third option because I suspect I will be best at remembering it and improvising what I don't. The dungeon I'll be describing is one that I hope to eventually release to the public.)

## Incorporate the Drive

Pause the game when anything interesting on the road happens. When the moment is over:

* Other Car Causes Danger: Random encounter.
* Enter Traffic: Obstacle.
* An Out of State Plate: add a trap or other danger.

(Adapted from an idea by Kurt Potts.)

## Mystery Box

The player must only look in envelopes when instructed and must only read the appropriate cards.

### Pre-rolled Index Card Character Sheets

Here is my [Knave Index Card Character Sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iJq5P1My8115l1mI8ZNpZn-Lo8vJ7neV).

### Blank Index Cards

The player will write notes for herself on these. The GM will occasionally dictate further notes if absolutely necessary.

### Monster Envelope

Write monster**names and/or descriptionson index cards**. Description should give hint to players about monster and should remind GM of special attacks and such. GM makes up stats on the spot.



**Random encounter**= player pulls card at random.

### NPC Envelope

Write character names and player-facing descriptions that the player will read aloud to the GM.

### Map Envelopes

Map Envelopes 1-10 correspond to keyed areas of the dungeon (areas 1-10) and each contain a player-facing map piece,*a la* Sleeping Place of the Feathered Swine. Each piece says what numbers it connects to, so the GM doesn't have to tell the player which envelope to open next. Each piece also has a brief player-facing description that the player will read aloud to the GM.

### Treasure Tables

The player will roll on a standard treasure table when the GM wishes to describe most treasure:

| D6  | Item                                                                               | Value | Adjective   |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1   | \[Adjective Interesting Treasure] (see below)                                      | 5GP   | Slimy       |
| 2   | \[Adjective] pot or pan                                                            | 10GP  | Crusty      |
| 3   | Sharp, rusty, \[adjective] chopping knife                                          | 20GP  | Blackened   |
| 4   | 3 \[adjective] vials of olive oil                                                  | 30GP  | Moldy       |
| 5   | Sausage in \[adjective] wax paper                                                  | 50GP  | Muddy       |
| 6   | \[Adjective] Bag containing a spice (d6: brown, red, yellow, orange, black, white) | 100GP | Pastel blue |



The player will also occasionally roll on a rare treasure table:

| D8  | Item                                                                              |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Aquarium of live, very rare, ultra delicious shellfish.                           |
| 2   | The sharpest paring knife ever used in a kitchen.                                 |
| 3   | Special salt that almost instantly dessicates anything down into jerky.           |
| 4   | Auto-spicing spoon that spices a dish to perfection.                              |
| 5   | Localized gravity cutting board, ensuring no slippage.                            |
| 6   | Condenser that makes one gallon of broth into a marble.                           |
| 7   | A bracelet with cooking utensils for charms that grow to full size when detached. |
| 8   | Extractor fan that sucks up cooking smells into a bottle.                         |

## Know One Important NPC by Heart

### **Amée**

**Player-facing NPC card:Amée**is apot-bellied pig humanoid woman with a sunken face. Seems very reasonable.

**GM secret knowledge**: She rages at intentional or careless violence against mushrooms.\
**Wants**:

To help mushroom-friends.\
To cook and eat fancy mushroom dishes. Doesn't know she's addicted to mushrooms.\
To remember her husband fondly and await his "return." (She saw the mushrooms kill him. She is in denial and pretended he was an elk and ate him.)



**Doesn't want**:

To step on mushrooms.

To eat food without mushrooms.

Unnecessary violence.

Anyone to know she's the daughter of a lord.


**Attacks**: 2. Barbecue skewer, d4 "exploding" (Result 4 = roll again and add results together.)

\
**Special**: Release**spores**. All non-mushrooms save to avoid or to suffer partial effect (GM choice.) (Their heads fold back nearly 180 degrees to fully open their mouths.)

\
**Wants**:\

Interesting bacteria.\
Water.\
To meet new kinds of mushrooms.\
**Doesn't want**:\
