(I think Dan's list of [favorite things](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2019/01/a-few-of-my-favorite-things-plus-extra.html) might have inspired this post. I honestly don't remember. It's good though, so check it out too.)

Want to grab a bunch of content from the internet and just run it without spending money on adventures/settings and without spending time making your own stuff?

Here are the very best I've found. These are*quality*.

* [Fomalhaut and other adventures by Melan (Gabor Lux.)](http://unvisiblecitadel.blogspot.com/2015/05/melan-gabor-lux-bibliography-and.html) Not all of these are free.
* [H.M.S. Appolyon and Fallen Empire](http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/)
* [Tomb of the Serpent Kings](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/252934/Tomb-of-the-Serpent-Kings--Deluxe-Print-Edition)

Useful but I don't have enough experience with them to consider them favorites:

* [Trilemma's one-page and two-page adventures](http://blog.trilemma.com/)
* [Dyson Logos adventures](https://dysonlogos.blog/maps/adventures/)

What did I miss? Tell me in the comments.

### Submitted recommendations I can't personally vouch for:

[One Page Dungeons](https://www.dungeoncontest.com/)(you'll have to sift through them for the good ones yourself. Comment with your favorites and I'll add them.)

[Secret Santicore](http://santicore.blogspot.com/)(see above.)
