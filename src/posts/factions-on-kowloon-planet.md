I made a [faction generator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12msnB7Jky8AKm_qQEP6f64XHtKMYlZBKC3w_pvhp4uA/edit?usp=sharing) for my sci-fantasy setting. I'm proud of it. It's neat.\
\
It has **types**, **traits**, **connections**, and **conflict**. Part of it doubles as an NPC generator that creates **appearance**, **personality**, **motivation**.\
\
You can make a copy and then edit the file if you like because it's a Google Doc.

### Caveats

Two elements may make it less immediately useful for you:\
1. Magic is essentially unknown, so there's only a 3% chance of any faction being innately magical (only one entry is about wizards, for example.)\
2. Technology is sought out in much the same way magic is in a vanilla fantasy campaign.
