Each of these conditions should be important to modeling issues of survival in harsh environments, but mechanics for them are usually much more complicated than I would ever enjoy as a player or as a referee.

Making conditions simply occupy inventory slots is a meaningful, appropriate mechanic, and you could really just stop there, but I added a bit more for some conditions.\

Fatigue, Soaked, Cold, Overheated, Starvation, Famishment, and Thirst** use 1 Inventory slot each.

## **Fatigue**

Fatigue is gained as a result of exhausting activity. A character may have more than one Fatigue.\
Fatigue applies a [Bane](https://buildingsarepeople.blogspot.com/2018/11/boons-and-banes.html) to all rolls. (this effect does not stack.) A night's rest only removes one Fatigue.\
Fatigue can be caused by:

* getting fewer than 8 hours of sleep in a day.
* traveling more than 12 hours in one day (+1 Fatigue per additional hour. A player character may check Constitution to resist gaining Fatigue from travel.)

## **Soaked**

Soaked is caused by being very wet. Soaked things are not on fire and may not be lit.

## **Cold**

Cold is caused by exposure to a very cold environment.

## **Overheated**

Overheated is caused by exposure to a very hot environment.

## Famished

Every 24 hours without food, gain one Famished and lose one Constitution point.

## Thirst

Lose 1D6 Con per day (or per 12 hours if overheated) without water. Assume there is a water source available nearby whenever characters are outdoors unless the environment would indicate otherwise.
