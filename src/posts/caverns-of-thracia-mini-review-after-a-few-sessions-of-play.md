I've been running The Caverns of Thracia for a while in a duet game with my wife.

I also run a discord chat PbP-ish Thracia game.

I just now started a new Thracia game with my wife and 2 (until now) 5e-only players. I'm playtesting my BB\X rules with that group.

\+ easy to interpret dungeon details into an overall understanding of the broad situation. Very grokkable
\+ most keyed locations are quickly understood without need of interpretation
\+ amazing 3-dimensionality and general dungeon layout
\+ Factions are good enough and minimal enough to grow naturally through gameplay. They might be better if a smidge more detailed, but they have just the right gaps to fill for me, so far.
\+ the whole dungeon is a layered mystery to uncover through exploration and diplomatic play, if the party cares
\+ mechanical simplicity. I mostly don't need to look things up or stop to consider what ruling to make

\- crammed, dense layout
\- some unclear mapping and keying
\- poorly organized
\- lots of page flipping
\- too verbose
\- some errors and missed opportunities

**Highlight 1**: endless ways to get lost, accidentally go deeper, and master the dungeon through using different routes.

**Highlight 2**: the game is complex, layered, and interesting without a confused GM staring and thinking and referencing other pages all the time. (I had those issues with Maze of the Blue Medusa and Hot Springs Island. You may find them a better fit for you though, of course.)

We're [attempting to fix](https://buildingsarepeople.blogspot.com/2018/11/creating-terse-key-and-more-for-caverns.html) most of the minuses from my review with a rewritten key.
