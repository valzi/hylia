## Mechanics

Herbs with a rarity of 0 may be found by scavenging for herbs.

Roll a d12 on the *Replaced Spells* list when foraging for herbs to gain the associated herb. Those with special knowledge may roll a larger die. Rarer herbs must usually be found by questing, but may occasionally be available for purchase.

## Cost

| Herb Level | Baseline Cost |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 0          | 100 GP        |
| 1          | 200 GP        |
| 2          | 600 GP        |
| 3          | 800 GP        |
| 4          | 1000 GP       |
