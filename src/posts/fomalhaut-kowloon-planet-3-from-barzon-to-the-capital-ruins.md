In Barzon, an island on the Kowloon Planet. (See [previous posts](https://buildingsarepeople.blogspot.com/search/label/Kowloon%20Planet).)

* Sent Denton to scout out dock - Svanth is checking out docks with Flying Gods (wasps under his control by way of a cube device) hovering overhead.
* Discussed whether to take risks killing the hated Ullkmaran and decided to be practical instead. Party is disappointed.
* Gang dressed in the armor uniforms of Ullkmaran's dead guards from the warehouse.
* Started loading ship; tried to convince Svanth we're part of Ullkmaran's crew.
* Zena convinces ship guard we're part of crew; she was hired as guard
* Loaded more supplies, killed guard in warehouse.
* Denton prepare ship to depart
* Threw diambroid at governor Svanth on the dock; blown to bits and fire started.
* Blew up other ship with remaining diambroid.
* Pangea is captain. Zena is first mate.
* Traveled by night to 1408, 1508, 1607, 1707. 1 ship ration consumed.
* Traveled to 2105. Ran aground on sandbar. Sent crew into boats to lessen weight. Took 4 hours to scrape past.
* Arrived at port at 12:00 noon. Spent another ship ration.
* 6 other ships at dock. Decided to drink with crew to celebrate and boost morale. Persuaded all 16 to remain with us.
* Awaited at dock by
* * man who wanted us to explore the wilderness.
  * bearded old librarian man. Wizard?
  * guy who says he can't currently discuss the work he'd like us to do but that we should meet him in the blue building.
  * mafia lady who offers "family."
* Zena and Pangea both spent weeks in town taking hallucinogenics to expand their minds and each learned a new spell.
* * Pangea lost 1 wisdom and learned to hold and expel 10x the normal amount of breath.
  * Zena learned a ranged pilfering spell.

Post-game questions for the players:

1.*What was the best accomplishment?*Exploding Svanth.

2.*What do you want to do next?*Establish an alliance with a local faction.

3.*What would improve the game?*The referee should take better notes. (I couldn't remember several details.)
