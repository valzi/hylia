## 20 Campaign Questions

1. What is the deal with my cleric's religion?

Clerics have never existed.

Small gods have small influence and can be physically met in person. They've been known to die by mortal hands.

2. Where can we go to buy standard equipment?

Access sells the basics. Other things require travel to a different city state or working for a faction.

3. Where can we go to get platemail custom fitted for this monster I just befriended?

Plate armor is only available at exorbitant prices or occasionally as a perk of sworn service to a faction.

4. Who is the mightiest wizard in the land?

It seems they're all dead. Not that there ever were many.

5. Who is the greatest warrior in the land?

Probably one of the members of one of the groups that've been scavenging the capital blocks.

6. Who is the richest person in the land?

One of the merchants in one of the other city-states. Probably a port city. 

7. Where can we go to get some magical healing?

Nowhere. Maybe there is some ancient tech or a medical facility in one of the capital blocks. That's just wishful thinking.

8. Where can we go to get cures for the following conditions: poison, disease, curse, level drain, lycanthropy, polymorph, alignment change, death, undeath?

If you find out, let me know. I bet whoever can do that can also turn dirt clods into bacon, velvet, and gold.

9. Is there a magic guild my MU belongs to or that I can join in order to get more spells?

There are no magic users known to human civilization, but the natives on the other side of the world make all sorts of elaborate claims.

10. Where can I find an alchemist, sage or other expert NPC?

Experts are generally in big cities and not in villages. Some have also gathered in Access. 

11. Where can I hire mercenaries?

From among a faction's members, if they're militaristic. Most factions will not allow a non-member to hire, if there are even people that are interested in hiring themselves out.

12. Is there any place on the map where swords are illegal, magic is outlawed or any other notable hassles from Johnny Law?

Magic isn't illegal anywhere, but only because lawmakers generally don't believe it exists. 

13. Which way to the nearest tavern?

Most places have one. 

14. What monsters are terrorizing the countryside sufficiently that if I kill them I will become famous?

None.

15. Are there any wars brewing I could go fight?

Sure. Are there any sheep you could go herd? Sure. Why? 

16. How about gladiatorial arenas complete with hard-won glory and fabulous cash prizes?

No. If there were, your character would probably die while the rest of the players were on their phones waiting for a chance to play. 

17. Are there any secret societies with sinister agendas I could join and/or fight?

Yes. 

18. What is there to eat around here?

Meat and fruit and veggies and bread. 

19. Any legendary lost treasures I could be looking for?

Terraforming machines. 

20. Where is the nearest dragon or other monster with Type H treasure?

Well, first, where are you? Maybe there's a hoard in one of the capital towers.
