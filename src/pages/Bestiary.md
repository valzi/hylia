## Encounters

4. Rival party. (See _Rival Parties_.)

5. Bandits
Ambush and loot other explorers, killing them if afraid to let them live or if they're uncooperative. http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2015/05/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html

8. Obsessed Tinkerer
   with tools and stashed keys

9. Cult
   Totally devoted suppliers of the elder families at the top of the towers. They bring gardening stuff, ugly enslaved women (less likely to be discontent), and raw materials.
   Weak. 1d6.

11. Children of the Capital
    Thin, gangly people who always look about 20-40 years older than they are. Surgically granted specialized knowledge about one kind of tech, as an adolescent rite of passage. The knowledge is subconscious, but most will, eventually, at least once in their lifetime, be taken by a fit of isolationism and craft a marvelous artifact. No one knows the artifact is dependent on the rite, which is only a superstitious tradition.

12. Traders consist of 3-18 level 1 fighters, with 1-4 mules, engaged primarily in excavation and recovery of artifacts - they'll be armed, and will also have shovels, picks, and digging equipment. 

13. Veterans
    A group of veterans is a mix of 2-12 fighters of levels 1-3, per the BX rules.  Unlike traders, these Vikings explore the ruins seeking monster lairs and creatures to fight and loot.

14. Wight/Wraith/Specter

# Creatures

Butterfly Migration - Sapphire lords, a butterfly with a 2’ wingspan, rich vibrancy and long feathery antenna travel in locust like swarms.  They are defenseless to the birds that trail after them nibbling at the edges of the swarm.  The birds dare not eat too many as the butterflies are deadly poisonous, even to a larger creature if eaten in bulk (a meal’s worth requires a Save v. Poison).

Blue Monks (2D6) - blue monks roam from the city on a mission from their “god”, they are unlikely to talk but also unlikely to attack, preferring to return immediately to the city a inform their fellows before organizing a hunt for trespassers to sacrifice.

Slave laborers digging, mining, breaking walls, building stairs.
