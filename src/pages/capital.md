## The World

### What Was

* Over 200 years ago, two Empires formed a treaty agreeing that neither would interfere with this contested planet, that it would simply be ignored.
* Criminals, anarchists, religious extremists, and other desperate folk fled to it as a safe haven, but they had no way of maintaining tech, mostly due to lack of expertise.
* Constant upheaval of government, gang warfare, and philosophical movements against various kinds of knowledge removed what little stability remained.

### What Is

* Ancient artifacts  include laser guns, holograms, screens, keycards, hydroelectric generators, terraforming walls, water purifiers, batteries. No one understands how to create these things.
* Electricity is not understood. Elders provide some maintenance knowledge, but it's ritualistic and often incorrect.
* Only a few know the half-true stories about what happened.
* Since most who fled to here were criminals, protesters, and paranoid libertarians, the culture tends toward fealty and isolation.
* Another "alien" civ (actually the only natives) on the other side of the planet mostly keep to their continent, but some immigrate. This is where knowledge of magic (mostly witchy magic) is kept secret from the offworlders.
* Automatons continue their endless tasks.
* Ancient writings often have words similar to modern writings and usually use the same alphabet. Most books are from Empire 1. Empire 2 books use a different alphabet.

## Access (Capital Access City)

![Access](/images/access.png)

* Capital Access City is better known as "Access."
* Economy is built on trade of items and information from the Capital and services for those who wish to explore/scavenge it. Many factions and individual patrons due to "gold rush" competitiveness/excitement/greed.
* Limited resources. Most goods are at a high cost.
* No access to magical items or services.
* Local merchants usually pay 60% of value for goods they're interested in and then export for resale.
* Local faction provides access to dungeon entrance and passage back out as a paid service.
* A giant burning tire heap. the city threatens to remove the tire heap as it's a blight on the city but armed residents fight back as they use the tires for fuel during the winter.

### Daily chaos event check

**Chaos**

1 ☐ 2 ☐ 3 ☐ 4 ☐ 5 ☐ 6 ☐ 7 ☐ 8 ☐ 9 ☐

Each time the players do something that would increase instability in the city, fill in another box. If they improve things, erase a filled box. Each day that they are in the city, roll on the matching table below.

## Capital Wilderness

* A is easily reached from the city. Walking to the outside of E is more dangerous than traveling through the other highrises, if you have keys to move through them and know how to do so.

## Capital Towers

![Kowloon-capital-TOP](/images/Kowloon-capital-TOP.png)

![Kowloon-capital](/images/Kowloon-capital.png)

* Most remaining tech is in the Capital, a dense, piecemeal hub that was a port city on the center of the larger continent (there are only two) for space trade.

  * Mysterious, untainted tech is rumored to be on the highest floors, guarded by traditional tribes and hermits.
* From a distance, it's a giant semi-cuboid made of 5 concrete highrises connected by makeshift bridges.
* Traps originally existed to protect property/gang territory etc. Some are still for that purpose and some are recently-built, but many are ancient and technologically advanced.

### General Layout

* Sealed floors, broken elevators, collapsed stairwells, etc. connect between one highrise and the next. They're often intentionally barricaded or caved in.
* Navigating occasionally requires parkour, bridge-building, climbing, or the use of a zip line.
* It's not a city anymore. It's a claustrophobic, half-vertical wilderness with occasional settled spaces.
* Many locations, even in A, are completely blocked (often by dangerous defenses) and require a key to access.
* Each tower is large enough to house a city state or two, but they're mostly abandoned.

### Base level

* automated defenses. The one at A is deactivated or destroyed.
* Unhinged ai god faction. Robots and cyborgs that are under direct ai control.

### Basement

Subway tunnels. Excellent way to move between towers if you have a key to the building you intend to go to. There's also a set of keys that will allow the train to move between buildings.

### Upper level

* contains hidden wonders: archives, cultural texts, and manuals.
* connects all highrises to each other
* houses a civilization of isolationist engineers who understand most of the city's technology and guard it closely, including a huge library of ordinary books, but especially manuals. They do not attach religious significance to technology or books.
*

### Rumored  Magnificent Treasures of the Towers

1. Terraforming machines

### Tower A

Just north of Access. Many know important details, but much information is guarded closely because those who have been there have a vested interest in exploring faster and further than anyone else, lest their prize be taken or destroyed by someone else. It will be hard to gather more than rumors. Gathering intel about deeper areas is difficult.

The buildings nearby are generally under 10 stories tall. Unsealed buildings house bandits and monsters.

#### Wandering Monsters

##### 1 Cyborgs

LCD displays text to allow conversation.

Goals: 

* Install tech.
* Gather allies with enhancement tech.
* Social allies who do not accept tech are acceptable. Strongly positive interactions incur invitation to speak with AI. 
* Kill non-allies.

Stats as zombie. 

Tech installed in a character by a cyborg works but the character has an x-in-6 chance to become unthinking servant of AI (like the cyborgs) when tech is installed. X = the number of pieces of tech the character has installed, including the new one.

### Utility Treasure

* Human-sized fixture (resembles a shower) with indentations for feet in the floor and head in the wall. Many pencil-sized holes. If a character stands on the indentations, mechanical arms perform one of the following operations (1d6):

  1. Electrical malfunction - shocks anyone within 5' for 1d8.
  2. Implants AI in brain, alongside recipient's mind
  3. Transfers tech knowledge to recipient's mind. (Each station only has one set of information.)
  4. Amputates limb and replaces with cybernetic limb of great strength. (Does not modify stats, but is quite handy in relevant situations.)
  5. Something is placed in the character's head, increasing their Intelligence by 1 point.
  6. Character no longer needs to breathe.
* Oxygen tank and mask.
* Chimes of unique timbres.
* Wind Barrier device: Swirling winds deflect incoming and outgoing small missiles such as arrows or spears. May shelter # people = to Level of operator.
* Battery
* Electronic key 1-8 Red (10gp) 2-5 gems
  9-11 Orange (50gp) 2-4 gems
  12-14 Yellow (100gp) 1-3 gems
  15-16 Green (250gp) 1-2 gems
  17-18 Blue (500gp) 1 gem
  19 Indigo (1000gp) 1 gem
  20 Violet (5000gp) 1 gem
* Fuse
* Operating manual
* Textbook
* Metal disc the size of a poker chip. Adheres to a flat surface. Applies spell-like effect to an object for duration of battery.
* Exposed cabling/conduit
* Raygun. 30' ray (organic things must save or disintegrate. Doesn't work on inorganic objects. 1 in 6 chance of exploding for 4d6 damage to everyone in a 20' radius.
* +1 weapon, made from strange metal.
* Strange metal. 1-2, small; 3-4, medium, 5-6 large.  The alloy is light, durable, and nearly impossible to bend; the right smith could forge it into a mundane +1 armor or weapon
* Ancient art. (Use reproductions of real art from Earth. Reproductions are as valuable as the real thing.)
* Damaged gear from other parties.
* Hazard suit with ½ damage reduction or full immunity on a Save v. Breath against acid and similar corrosive substances.
* Collar. When worn, spinal needle extends, injecting the wearer with a chemical that causes melee attacks against any living creature within 30’ at +2 Attack, +2 Damage, but -2 AC.  To avoid continued attacks, the victim may Save once a round.
* Drain Cleaner -  save or take 4D6 disintegration damage. Applies to organic matter.
* Bomb. May be set to explode after 1D4 rounds. 30’ radius. Kills any human-sized target that fails a save vs. spells and 2D6 damage to those who succeed.
* Filter will turn any water-based liquid (wine, slime) into water.
* Belt with heavy box buckle with a switch on it. Envelops wearer in tinted field that obscures physical features. AC+2 against ranged and AC+1 against melee. Lasts 1d6 hours.

Every item has a 1 in 20 chance of being cursed. Cursed items :

1. AI controls character at half hp. Save.

### Tower Hazards

* Spinning industrial fans
* Exposed electrical wiring (electrified floor/circuit breaker/generator)
* Pipes transporting explosive gas, labeled
* hazardous chemical feeds for massive scale 3d printing
* automated forklifts that carry things around on poorly marked lanes at 90 mph
* various low tech booby traps guarding a small encampment
* Stacks of old machinery parts that have been built up over many years, which could collapse at the slightest touch.
* medical machine that injects anything passing through a door with an immunization medicine that causes severe nausea.
* steam vents
* Motion sensing doors that greet people loudly, alerting anyone in earshot.

### Tower Encounters

1. Rival party. (See _Rival Parties_.)

2. Bandits
   Ambush and loot other explorers, killing them if afraid to let them live or if they're uncooperative. http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2015/05/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html

3. Obsessed Tinkerer
   with tools and stashed keys

4. Cult
   Totally devoted suppliers of the elder families at the top of the towers. They bring gardening stuff, ugly enslaved women (less likely to be discontent), and raw materials.
   Weak. 1d6.

5. Children of the Capital
   Thin, gangly people who always look about 20-40 years older than they are. Surgically granted specialized knowledge about one kind of tech, as an adolescent rite of passage. The knowledge is subconscious, but most will, eventually, at least once in their lifetime, be taken by a fit of isolationism and craft a marvelous artifact. No one knows the artifact is dependent on the rite, which is only a superstitious tradition.

6. Traders consist of 3-18 level 1 fighters, with 1-4 mules, engaged primarily in excavation and recovery of artifacts - they'll be armed, and will also have shovels, picks, and digging equipment. 

7. Veterans
   A group of veterans is a mix of 2-12 fighters of levels 1-3, per the BX rules.  Unlike traders, these Vikings explore the ruins seeking monster lairs and creatures to fight and loot.

8. Wight/Wraith/Specter

9. Butterfly Migration - Sapphire lords, a butterfly with a 2’ wingspan, rich vibrancy and long feathery antenna travel in locust like swarms.  They are defenseless to the birds that trail after them nibbling at the edges of the swarm.  The birds dare not eat too many as the butterflies are deadly poisonous, even to a larger creature if eaten in bulk (a meal’s worth requires a Save v. Poison).

10. Blue Monks (2D6) - blue monks roam from the city on a mission from their “god”, they are unlikely to talk but also unlikely to attack, preferring to return immediately to the city a inform their fellows before organizing a hunt for trespassers to sacrifice.

11. Slave laborers digging, mining, breaking walls, building stairs.

12. Rival Party
